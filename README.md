# Notes on the workshop examples

- Brissy_girls workshop uses data on wildlife spotted around Brisbane. The tutorial can be viewed by going to https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/sunny_tutorial/, and two apps produced during the workshop are at https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/Claudia_brissy_wildlife/ (looks at seasonal appearance of wildlife), and https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/Rachel_brissy_wildlife/ (makes it possible to compare two species occurrences)
- The NZ girls workshop focuses on an app for analysing the PISA test data, the tutorial can be viewed at https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/kea_tutorial/
- More workshop materials for high school students is available at https://github.com/Monash-BDCD, with data on an individual's household energy consumption in Melbourne, and another examining AFLW statistics.

# Teaching examples

We wish to provide a resource enabling more diverse and inclusive examples to be used in teaching R. Often examples are based on subjects that tend to be more appealing to men (men's sport, cars, finance) or have a US/Western bias (politics, movies/pop songs). While such examples may still be interesting to people that don't usually think much about these things, more diverse and inclusive examples will help to engage a wider set of people.

Action focuses on three points:

1. Detect and discourage use of "bad" widely used examples
2. Collect/produce more diverse examples
3. Collect/produce examples about gender and inclusivity

# Project Organization

At the moment we are just collecting information on existing examples or sources of data that might provide relevant examples and bringing together those that have expressed an interest. This may be further developed as a webpage of resources for teachers and/or one or more R packages of examples.

## Examples suggested by the community

### More diverse examples

Examples beyond topics that tend to be more appealing to men, or assume a certain cultural background. In particular avoiding: men's sports, cars, finance, national politics, specific TV/movie series and the like.

- [RGB values of 20x20 pixel images of Bob Ross-style paintings](https://github.com/sctyner/joy-of-clustering/blob/master/clean_paint_data.csv)
- [Best in Show - what's the top data dog?](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/best-in-show-whats-the-top-data-dog/) looking at a score based on dog characteristics vs dog popularity. Google Sheet with all variables underlying score. From Information is Beautiful; other nice examples are [Mountains out of Molehills - media inflamed fears](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/mountains-out-of-molehills/), data from Google trends.
- [Data Technologies book](https://github.com/heike/data-technologies) early draft by Heike Hofmann and Di Cook has some different data examples.

### Examples on gender, inclusivity and humanitarian issues
